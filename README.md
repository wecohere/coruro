# Coruro
Coruro is a [capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara)-inspired testing library for emails and similar messages. It is designed to allow querying messages your application sent while running outside of your application process. This makes it easier to parallelize tests and shrink test suite startup time.

Coruro depends on [Mailcatcher](https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher), which acts as a fake SMTP server for mail delivery purposes. Additional adapters will come later.

## Features
* Query emails sent during a test run like any other API.
* Get a collection of messages or a single message back and make assertions.
* Manage Mailcatcher in your feature test suite without having to juggle processes.

## Usage
We currently only have a [Ruby](./coruro-ruby) implementation, but expect more languages as we build projects across more languages. Check your implementation's README for documentation:

* [Ruby](./coruro-ruby/README.md)
